	<p>A CCORDING to the late F. C. S. Schiller, the greatest ob-
Xj3L stacle to fruitful discussion in philosophy is "the curious
etiquette which apparently taboos the asking of questions about
a philosopher's meaning while he is alive." The "interminable
controversies which fill the histories of philosophy," he goes on
to say, "could have been ended at once by asking the living
philosophers a few searching questions."</p>
